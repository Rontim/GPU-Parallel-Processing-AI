# GPU Parallel Processing in AI

This repository explores the use of **GPU parallel processing** in the context of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, specifically leveraging GPUs for accelerating computations in deep learning tasks. This project is designed for hands-on experimentation using both **Google Colab** and **school lab GPUs**. The goal is to gain a practical understanding of how GPUs can be used for tasks like training AI models faster, performing large-scale matrix operations, and improving the efficiency of parallel algorithms.

## Topics Covered
- **Introduction to GPU Parallel Programming**
  - Basics of GPU architecture
  - Introduction to **CUDA** and **OpenCL**
  - Writing simple parallel programs (e.g., matrix multiplication, parallel reductions)

- **AI with GPU Acceleration**
  - Accelerating AI tasks with **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
  - Training models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers using GPUs
  - Fine-tuning models for better performance

- **Benchmarking GPU Performance**
  - Comparing **CPU vs GPU** performance in deep learning tasks
  - Profiling and optimizing GPU-based AI applications
  - Using tools like `nvprof`, `nvidia-smi`, and `tensorboard` for performance monitoring

- **Practical Applications and Experiments**
  - Hands-on code examples for using GPUs in AI applications
  - Training deep learning models on **Google Colab** (with GPU) and **school lab GPUs**
  - Benchmarks and experiments to measure speedup from GPU acceleration

## Getting Started

### **Google Colab:**
You can start experimenting with GPUs using Google Colab. Simply open the respective notebook in the `colab_notebooks/` folder to begin training models or running experiments on the cloud-based GPU.

### **School Lab GPUs:**
For local experimentation, make sure your school lab GPU has the necessary software installed:
- **CUDA Toolkit**
- **cuDNN** (for AI tasks)
- **PyTorch or TensorFlow** (for deep learning models)
- **nvidia-smi** (to monitor GPU usage)

Follow the setup instructions in the `/docs/setup.md` file to configure your local GPU environment.
